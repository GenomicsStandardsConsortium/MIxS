MIxS 5 consists of 5 checklists:
- Minimum Information about a (Meta)Genome Sequence (MIGS/MIMS)
- Minimum Information about a Marker Gene (MIMARKS)
- Minimum Information about a Single Amplified Genome (MISAG) 
- Metagenome-Assembled Genome (MIMAG)
- Minimum Information about an Uncultivated Virus Genome (MIUViG)

To create a single entry point to all minimum information checklists from the GSC and to the corresponding environmental packages, we created an overarching framework, the MIxS standard (publication in Nature Biotechnology). MIxS includes the technology-specific checklists from the previous MIGS and MIMS standards, provides a way of introducing additional checklists such as MIMARKS, and also allows annotation of sample data using environmental packages.

The five checklists that are currently under MIxS share the same central set of core descriptors, but have checklist specific descriptors as well. Additionally, they enable a detailed description of environment through the use of optional environmental packages.

All five checklists in MIxS 5 can be accessed using the Excel spreadsheet in this folder. Full instructions for understanding the file are on the first sheet, in yellow.

The Environmental Packages that are part of MIxS 5 are also available for download from this directory.
