title: Normative References
---

MIxS specification relies on several other standards and ontologies, in whole or in part, which are normatively referenced in the specification and are indispensable for its application. For dated references, only the edition cited applies. For undated references, the latest edition of the referenced document (including any amendments) applies.
## Standards
1. **NIST Special Publications 811 (Guide for the Use of the International System of Units) and 330 (The International System of Units)** _A brief summary of the SI, the modern metric system of measurement_
2. **ISO 8601** _Representation of dates and times; an international standard covering the exchange of date and time-related data_

## Ontologies
1. **Chemical Entities of Biological Interest Ontology [(CHEBI)](http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/CHEBI)** _A structured classification of chemical compounds of biological relevance_
2. **Crop Ontology [(CO)](http://www.cropontology.org/ontology/CO_715/Crop%20Research)** _An ontology of validated concepts along with their inter-relationships on anatomy, structure and phenotype of Crops, on trait measurement and methods as well as on Germplasm with the multi-crop passport terms_
3. **Disease Ontology [(DO)](http://www.disease-ontology.org)** _A standardized ontology for human disease with the purpose of providing the biomedical community with consistent, reusable and sustainable descriptions of human disease terms, phenotype characteristics and related medical vocabulary disease concepts_
4. **Environment Ontology [(ENVO)](http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/ENVO)** _A domain ontology concerned with "environments" of all kinds and aims to promote standardisation and interoperability of diverse data sets through the concise, controlled description of environment types across several levels of granularity_
5. **Experimental Factor Ontology [(EFO)](http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/EFO)** _An application focused ontology modelling the experimental variables in multiple resources at the EBI and Open Targets_
6. **Foundational Model of Anatomy Ontology [(FMA)](http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/FMA)** _An ontology for the representation of classes or types and relationships necessary for the symbolic representation of the phenotypic structure of the human body_
7. **Gazetteer [(GAZ)](http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/GAZ)** _An open source gazetteer, constructed on ontological principles, that describes places and place names and the relations between them_
8. **[INSDC Country controlled vocabulary](http://www.insdc.org/country.html)** _Based on the list of countries or areas  used for statistical processing purposes by the Statistics Division of the United Nations Secretariat_
9. **Ontology for Biomedical Investigations [(OBI)](http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/OBI)** _an ontology of investigations, the protocols and instrumentation used, the material used, the data generated and the types of analysis performed on it_
10. **Phenotypic Quality Ontology [(PATO)](http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/PATO)** _An ontology of phenotypic qualities (properties, attributes or characteristics)_
11. **Plant Ontology [(PO)](http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/PO)** _A structured vocabulary and database resource that links plant anatomy, morphology and growth and development to plant genomics data_
12. **Plant Experimental Conditions Ontology [(PECO)](http://purl.bioontology.org/ontology/PECO)** _Describes the treatments, growing conditions, and/or study types used in plant biology experiments_
